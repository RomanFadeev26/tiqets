Please answer these questions once you have finished the assignment.

**What did you think of the assignment?**

It's very interesting and pretty big. It took a couple of full days for me, but it could be related with my low
experience in CSS Grid. And I can say this assignment improves my knowledge of it, and I'm grateful for that =)

**Which part did you consider the most difficult, or did you spend most of your time on?**

Mobile view of ProductCards. I use Grid rarely and never use it in production.

**Which parts were you not able to fully implement?**

I hope I implemented all parts, but I doubt about the level of accesebility.
And the second thing is truncating redundant lines. I'm not sure about working my approach in Firefox.

**What would you add or improve if you had more time?**

I would remove some wrappers for CSS from components related with city and country.
And find a safer approach to truncating lines.

**What would you do differently if it was a bigger application?**

I would choose another state-manager and add a library for UI components. My first iteration with this assignment included
Material UI, for example. But I removed it because it was written in the assignment about minimum external/3rd-party libraries.
I would use react-query for requests in conjunction with axios, maybe.
